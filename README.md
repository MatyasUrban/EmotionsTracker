# Emotions Tracker

This is my semester project in *Principles of Mobile Applications*  [B6B39PDA](https://bilakniha.cvut.cz/en/predmet3132306.html#gsc.tab=0) course as part of my Software Engineering undergraduate curriculum at the Czech Technical University in Prague, CZ, EU.

Designed, developed and programmed by  [Matyas Urban](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matyasurban/)  in Spring 2024.

## Overview
Emotions Tracker is a Swift-based iOS application designed to help users monitor and log their emotional states over time. The app leverages SwiftUI for its user interface, SwiftData for data persistence, and MapKit for geolocation features. This project was developed as part of a university course on mobile app development, adhering to the latest Apple Human Interface Guidelines and utilizing new capabilities introduced at WWDC 2023.
